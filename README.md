# VBA-Challenge

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this task is to refactor the code so that it works efficiently with a larger data set of stocks.
### Background
Steve would like to do more stock market research for his parents. He would like to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market. In addition to that Steven would like to expand the number of year. This would result in significantly increasing the data set, making it important to have a code that runs faster. 
This will be done by refactoring the code so that it loops through the data one time to collect the data.

## Results
### Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018
#### 2017
In the year 2017, 11 out 12 stocks had a postive rate of return

#### 2018
In the year 2018, only 2 out of 12 stock had a postive reate of return. 

#### Comparison
Based on the above findings, 2017 was a good year for investing, where as in 2018, the markets took a downward turn that resutled in 10 out of 12 stock giving a negative return.



### Execution Times of the Original and Refactored Script
The refactored script run much faster than the orignal. 

When running the analysis for 2017, the refactored code had a runtime of 0.17 seconds, compared to 0.87 seconds for the orignal code. Please refer to the screen shots below.

#### 2017 - Orignal Code

When running the analysis for 2018, the refactored code had a runtime of 0.16 seconds, compared to 0.86 secodns for the orignal code. Please refer to the screen shots below.

### Screen shots and Code

## Summary
### Advantages or Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
#### Advantages
* Refactored code takes fewer steps, there by decreasing the amount of time required to run the analysis
* The code uses less memory and computing power
* Refactoring the code can make it easier for others to read the code and follow the logic behind it.
#### Disadvantages
* Refactoring the code can create errors that will require more time to fix
* It may not be to a businesses financial advantage to invest money into refactoring code
* The original code is working, and refactoring it could cause disruptions

### How to the pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA Script
